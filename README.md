# Computer Vision Projects

## About This Project
This repository includes a collection of computer vision projects focused on image transformation, texture classification, object counting, convolution operations, and video segmentation. These projects utilize advanced techniques to analyze and process visual data.

## Built With
- **OpenCV**: Image and video processing.
- **NumPy**: Numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib**: Visualization of results.
- **Python**: Primary programming language for implementation.

## Features
- **Image Transformation**:  
  - Geometric and intensity-based transformations.
- **Texture Classification**:  
  - Classifies textures using feature extraction and machine learning techniques.
- **Object Counting**:  
  - Counts objects in images using contour detection and segmentation.
- **Convolution Operations**:  
  - Implements custom convolution filters for edge detection and blurring.
- **Video Segmentation**:  
  - Detects and segments moving objects in video streams.
